session -1 
Understanding logistic regression and implementation in python
This session also contains the conversion of linear regression to logistic regression

Session -2 
Implementing an activation function over the various fields of previous example
(A shallow neural network using tensor flow and keras) 

Session -3 
Mathematical representation of what is going on in the neural network mathematically . 
How do we understand this mathematics in laymans term.
After converting this into laymans term, we also implement these mathematical logic into our python notebook over same example.

session -4
Taking this concept one step ahead, understanding NN with one hidden layer
